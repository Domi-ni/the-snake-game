<P>A recreation of the Snake game, a famous and nostalgic game, especially for those who had a Nokia as their first phone. Made with python</p>
<p>In the game you control, using the arrow keys on the keyboard, a small snake, which when it eats a fruit (the blue dots) grows a little. The objective of the game is to eat as much as possible while avoiding hitting walls or your own tail. When you eat a fruit you score a point, if you hit your own tail or the or the edges of the screen you lose</P>
